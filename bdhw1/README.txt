Project: Big Data Homework 1 (Scrub)
Author: Juan Pablo Alonso

This program separates noise from signal given a very specific set of conditions.

EXEC: Scrub
INPUT: 
-1 filename (e.g. "data.txt")
-2 (OPT) 'd' will provide more output details
OUTPUT: 
-Print to screen partial batch processing time and (OPT) read and transform times
-file: noise.txt
-file: signal.txt

Note: The scrubbing and output happens in the same step, so it would be unfeasible to separate
the reported times.

The program executes relatively fast (8-12 seconds as tested for a 300mb file). The program is very
case-specific and will only identify noise generated by a set of pre-defined cases, including:
-Timestamp at 9 am
-Timestamp at 16 pm
-Timestamp on day ending at 2 (weekend identifier in this case) 
-Price over 5 dollars
-Price below -5 dollars
-Negative Volume
-Duplicate records within a window of 60 lines of records

The duplicates are found by comparing each record, using a char by char (starting at the end) 
comparison, to the next 60 records held in a structure of character arrays.
