Project: Big Data Homework 1 (Scrub)
Author: Juan Pablo Alonso

This program separates noise from signal given a very specific set of conditions.

REQUIREMENTS: cuda Thrust libraries are used with openMP as backend.

EXEC: Scrub
INPUT: 
-1 filename (e.g. "data.txt")
-2 (OPT) 'd' will provide more output details
OUTPUT: 
-Print to screen partial batch processing and transform times
Note: The scrubbing and output happens in the same step, so it would be unfeasible to separate
the reported times.
-file: noise.txt
-file: signal.txt

OPERATION: The program done in batches to prevent excessive memory usage. 
For each batch it first reads the input file up until the maximum batch size, extracting each line 
and storing it in a custom structure that holds groups of character lines. 

Each group of lines is then processed in parallel. A group of rules are tested for each line, and
any noise found is flagged in a custom boolean structure for future processing. The duplicates are 
found by comparing each line, using a char by char (starting at the end) comparison, to the next 60 lines. 

Once all noise has been flagged, the lines are sent to noise.txt and signal.txt as they belong.

The process is repeted if the total input lines exceed the maximum batch limit.

Note: While the program executes relatively fast (8-12 seconds as tested for a 300mb file). The program is very
case-specific and will only identify noise generated by a set of pre-defined cases, including:
-Timestamp at 9 am
-Timestamp at 17 pm
-Timestamp on day ending at 2 (weekend identifier in this case) 
-Price over 5 dollars
-Price below -5 dollars
-Negative Volume
-Duplicate records within a window of 60 lines of records
