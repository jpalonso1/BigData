Name: Scrub
Author: Juan Pablo Alonso

This program separates noise from signal given a very specific set of conditions.

INPUT: 
-filename (e.g. "data.txt")
OUTPUT: 
-Print to screen several performance measures and details of noise found
-file: noise.txt
-file: signal.txt

Note: Since reading the data, writing signal.txt and writing noise.txt happen simultaneously,
except for a negligible initial copy of 60 records to memory, it is not applicable to report 
time taken for each step, and only a cumulative scrub run time is provided as output.

The program executes relatively fast (20-25 seconds as tested for a 300mb file) and requires
minimal memory, holding at most 61 lines of records as string objects. The program is very
case-specific and will only identify noise generated by a set of pre-defined cases, including:
-Timestamp at 9 am
-Timestamp at 16 pm
-Timestamp on day ending at 2 (weekend identifier in this case) 
-Price over 5 dollars
-Negative Volume
-Duplicate records within a window of 60 lines of records

The duplicates are found by comparing each record, using basic string comparison, to the 
previous 60 records (or a moving window for the first 60 records) held in a string array. After 
each record is checked, the record is entered in to the string array by replacing the oldest 
record therein.
