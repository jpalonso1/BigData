Project: Big Data Homework 3 (Scrub 2)
Author: Juan Pablo Alonso

This program separates noise from signal given a very specific set of conditions.

REQUIREMENTS: mongoDB must be installed and active. for detailed instructions for installation please
visit: http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-linux/

EXEC: Scrub2
INPUT: 
filename (e.g. "data.txt")
OUTPUT: 
-Print to screen current lines entered into database, partial and total input and scrub times
-mongoDB collection hw3.noise
-mongoDB collection hw3.signal
-file: noise.txt
-file: signal.txt

OPERATION: The program reads the input file, parsing each line by separating date, value, and volume.
The parsed elements are transformed to a mongoDB-readable BSONObj object and added to a vector. Once
the vector is full, the BSONObj are inserted as a batch into the hw3.signal mongo database.
While this is happening, the program compares dates with the previous 60 dates to find duplicates. If
a duplicate is found it is inserted into hw3.noise instead.

After parsing is complete, the program finds the noise by running a series of queries in the created
database. The query results are assigned to cursor objects, which in turn are iterated through to move
the relevant documents from the hw3.signal to the hw3.noise database.

After scrubbing, it outputs the contents of the databases in the form of two text files: signal.txt and
noise.txt

Note: The program is very case-specific and will only identify noise generated by a set of pre-defined cases, 
including:
-Timestamp at 9 am
-Timestamp at 17 pm
-Timestamp on day ending at 2 (weekend identifier in this case) 
-Price over 5 dollars
-Price below -5 dollars
-Negative Volume
-Duplicate records within a window of 60 lines of records
